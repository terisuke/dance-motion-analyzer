# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Send details to the project maintainers privately
3. Allow reasonable time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files containing real credentials
- Use `.env.example` or `.env.template` files for documentation
- Store production secrets in secure vault systems

### API Keys
- Always use environment variables for API keys
- Implement proper rate limiting
- Use server-side proxy for sensitive API calls
- Rotate keys regularly

### Authentication
- JWT tokens expire after 30 minutes by default
- Refresh tokens expire after 7 days
- Passwords are hashed using secure algorithms
- Implement proper session management

### Data Protection
- All API communications should use HTTPS
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

### Dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor for security vulnerabilities using tools like:
  - `npm audit` for frontend
  - `pip-audit` or `safety` for backend
  - GitHub Dependabot alerts
